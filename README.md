# IBMHackathon
My submission for the 2021 qchack for the IBM Creative Challenge.

Some thoughts about what I coded, and why I coded it. 

I started out interested in the IBM Creative challenge, but didn't really know anything about quantum interference. After some reasearch I realized that the most basic form of interference was the hadamard gate. More specifically how it split the qubit into a superposition, but a second application would revert to the original form because interference with itself. 

After this realization I started playing around with the Hadamard gate, resulting in the file firstattempt.png. I realized that the circuit composer reminded me of a music staff. I was also thinking about music with interference. My only other experience with interference was with waves, which again reminded me of music. Finally I liked seeing that the circuit looked a bit like a music box. The firstattempt.png is when I was playing with the idea of Carol of the Bells, which took off. 

In my repository you'll find a video of a simulated Quantum computer running Carol of the Bells (in theory any song could be played with a minor amount of tinkering). Make sure you have your sound on! Also in the Graphs repository you'll find the full quantum circuit composed step by step. My original goal was to run the whole thing on a real Quantum Computer. However, since this would mean submitting a job for each note to generate the same type of video with the generated music, I didn't have time during this hackathon. 

My future plans for the project include extending it to more notes (sharps and flats, along with more octives) which should be easy enough with more qubits. Also I'd like to make it able to read a midi file and run the file on the quantum computer. 

Thank you so much for checking out my project, and I hope you enjoy!
